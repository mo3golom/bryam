# Project Agents.md Guide for AI agentic developer

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for AI agentic developers working with this codebase.

## Coding Conventions for AI agentic developer

### General Conventions
- AGENT SHOULD use the latest version of any package. Before add any dependency check the version using Context7
- AGENT HAVE TO add any dependency using "npm install ..." command
- AGENT HAVE TO use DOMAIN DRIVEN DESIGN and TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT approaches when implement new features
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in AI agentic developer output
- AGENT SHOULD add comments ONLY for complex logic as guided by Agents.md

### GIT
- AGENT HAVE TO commit all changes after implement the task using "git add ." and "git commit -m" commands. 
- AGENT SHOULD write meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made in the commit.

### Svelte and SvelteKit
- AGENT HAVE TO run "npm run check" when finished implement any task for checking and fixind errors
- AGGENT HAVE TO use "$env/dynamic/private" import for env variables.
Example:
```js
import { env } from '$env/dynamic/private';

export const supabase = createClient(env.SUPABASE_URL, env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
```

### Tailwindcss
- AGENT SHOULD follow the Tailwind zero-confg approach when implement new features

### Migrations Guidelines for AI agentic developer

- Write all new migrations in the `migrations` directory.
- Use the naming convention `NNN-description.sql` for migration files, where `NNN` is a three-digit number (e.g., `001`, `002`, etc.) and `description` is a short, descriptive name of the migration (e.g., `create-license-table`).
- Use PostgreSQL syntax in all new migrations generated by AI agentic developer.
- Each migration should have only an `up` direction. Do not include a `down` direction. Avoid adding `UP` and `DOWN` tags in the migration file.
- All SQL queries should be written in lowercase.
- Always ensure that the migration file is idempotent and can be safely applied multiple times without causing errors.
- Include comments in the migration file to explain the purpose of the migration and any complex logic.
- Avoid using DDL statements that are not supported by the target PostgreSQL version.
- Keep migration files focused on a single task or change to maintain clarity and simplicity.
- Example migration file:
  ```sql
  -- 011-create-license-table.sql

  create table license (
      id uuid primary key,
      name text not null,
      created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now()
  );
  ```
