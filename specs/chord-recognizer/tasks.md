## Development Notes

**Critical Requirements:**
- Strict adherence to AGENTS.md guidelines including Domain-Driven Design principles
- All dependencies must be installed using `npm install` commands
- Run `npm run check` after each implementation task
- Run `npm run test:run` only after successful check
- Test service using `npm run dev` and browser validation
- Commit changes with descriptive messages following `git add .` and `git commit -m` pattern

**Key Technical Considerations:**
- Real-time audio processing requires careful performance optimization
- Configurable thresholds (debounce, reset, clarity) need empirical testing
- Cross-browser Web Audio API compatibility is critical
- Proper resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Error handling for microphone permissions is essential

**Testing Strategy:**
- Separate tests for logic implementation and UI components
- Mock Web Audio API and canvas contexts for unit tests
- Focus on integration testing for real-time audio pipeline
- Performance testing for visualization and audio processing
